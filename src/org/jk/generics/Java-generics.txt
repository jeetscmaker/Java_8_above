The Need for Generics
--------------------------
Let's imagine a scenario where we want to create a list in Java to store Integer; we can be tempted to write:

List list = new LinkedList();
list.add(new Integer(1));
Integer i = list.iterator().next();

Surprisingly, the compiler will complain about the last line. It doesn't know what data type is returned.
The compiler will require an explicit casting:

Integer i = (Integer) list.iterator.next();
